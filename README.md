# AI & Machine Learning
## Description
This repository will store source code I create while learning AI and machine learning along with general information on both subjects in the future. AI and machine learning are two things I'm **very** interested in because they're both a big part of the future in my opinion and I plan to run a big division for a new project I'm making called [The Modding Community](https://moddingcommunity.com/forums/topic/7-our-vision-goals-partner-proposal/#comment-7) which will consist of many talented individuals/engineers where many will likely be interested in contributing to the project. It will be an open-source project hosted within TMC's GitHub organization [here](https://github.com/modcommunity).

While TMC is something that needs to take off first, I do have a lot of confidence it will in the future with our current team and this will allow us to retrieve funding for hosting AI/machine learning bots on high-end hardware for example.

## What Could AI & Machine Learning Software/Bots Do?
* Precisely learn programming/networking to the point where they can automatically look for security vunerabilities for individuals who opt-in and it only reports the vunerabilities.
* Take automation to a whole new level.
* Implementing AI & machine learning into physical *robots* and have them perform real-life tasks.
* Much more.

## Security Measurements
We are still far from this point and there is a lot of controversy going around whether AI could ever reach the point of reflecting close to human-like emotions (I don't know if this will ever be possible myself, but with how things are going technology-wise, you never know). However, even if we made it half-way to that point, there **will be** individuals making malicious AI & machine learning software/bots.

I'm really not sure if there's anything we can do to prevent malicious use since if AI & machine learning really does become as big as some hope/believe it will be, the community is going to need to figure out ways to elminate bad AI & machine learning software/bots.
