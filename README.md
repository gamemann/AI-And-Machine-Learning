# AI & Machine Learning
## Description
This repository will store source code I create while learning AI and machine learning along with general information on both subjects in the future. AI and machine learning are two things I'm **very** interested in because they're the future in my opinion and I plan to run a big division for a new project I'm making called [The Modding Community](https://moddingcommunity.com/forums/topic/7-our-vision-goals-partner-proposal/#comment-7) which will consist of many talented individuals/engineers where many will likely be interested in contributing to the project. It will be an open-source project hosted within TMC's GitHub organization [here](https://github.com/modcommunity).
